## Professional Statements
I am Ketmanto Wangsa. I am an Application Support Engineer at a Sydney-based CX consultancy. I provide IT technical support (Azure, Intune, Exchange, Entra ID), database extraction (SQL), and cyber security support. During a remote internship at a leading US supplier, I had the opportunity to serve as both Technical Support and Team Leader of the Sourcing Team. In addition, I completed the IBM Engagement Specialist program to enhance my interpersonal skills. Furthermore, I completed six cybersecurity virtual programs with ANZ, Datacom, Mastercard, AIG, Tata Consultancy, and Telstra. 

Recently, I completed the Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. The Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats. 

As of 2024, I am preparing to take the `Linux Foundation Certified Associate (LFCA)`, `CompTIA A+` and `CompTIA Security+` certifications.
