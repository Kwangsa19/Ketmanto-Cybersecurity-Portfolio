I have developed a cybersecurity portfolio showcasing various tasks and projects completed during my journey to earn the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. This program has provided insights into:
* Programming for cybersecurity tasks
* Frameworks and controls that inform security operations
* SIEM tools for cybersecurity
* Detecting and responding to incidents using an intrusion detection system
* Performing packet capture and analysis

Additionally, it has paved the way for me to pursue one of the entry-level following roles:
* Cybersecurity Analyst
* Security Analyst
* SOC Analyst
* Information Security Analyst
* IT Security Analyst
* Cyber Defense Analyst
